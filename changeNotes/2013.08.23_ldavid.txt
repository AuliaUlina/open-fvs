Subject: SpMcDBH Function - Inventory recent mortality

Variants affected: All

Description: When user specifies "Calulations are for Recent mortality" on the
             SpMcDBH function, values for inventory year (cycle 1) will be based
             on input data trees coded as recent mortality (tree history codes
             6 and 7). Previously, no values would be returned for inventory
             year.

Impact on users: Capability to use and report all SpMcDBH calculations based on
                 inventory recent mortality.

Files:
base\src\evldx.f - Modified for SpMcDBH to process dead tree records at end of
                   tree data arrays and key on IMC code 7 when cycle is 1 and
                   recent mortality values are specified.
base\src\fvs.f   - Suppressed the reset of dead tree record pointer (IREC2) so
                   the index value would remain availabel for SpMcDBH recent 
                   mortality calculations. At same point in code, reset the TPA
                   (PROB) values back to sample design specs, because they had
                   expanded based on mortality measurement period for density
                   purposes in calibration process.
