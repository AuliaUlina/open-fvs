#summary Windows build process for Visual Studio

=Getting Started with the Build Process in Windows using Visual Studio=

This wiki documents the process of setting things up on a Windows PC so you can build FVS executables from the source files in the open-fvs repository. Builds of 32-bit versions have been tested, and 64-bit builds will likely be tested by the end of 2013. For more information on the build process, including information for builds on other platforms (Mac and Linux) please refer to the [GettingStarted_Windows],[GettingStarted_MinGW] wikis or the [FAQ] wiki.

==Getting The Necessary Tools==

You will need Administrator privileges to install the necessary tools, so ensure you have that before proceeding.

Building with Visual Studio requires *Microsoft Visual Studio 2010* and the *Intel Fortran compiler 2012 (XE)*. More recent versions of Visual Studio (including free or lower cost "Express" versions), and other compliant compilers _may work_, but have not been tested. Information about VS2010 is found here: http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads. Information about the Intel compiler is found here: http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-visual-fortran-composer-xe-evaluation. You must have these both installed before continuing.

You will also need to install the Cmake system, which can be found here: http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html. Download and install the latest version. The Cmake build steps described below have been tested with Version 2.8.8 and require at least Version 2.6.

==Getting The Source Files==

Please see [GettingStarted_Windows] to find out about SVN clients and the FVS code base.

==Building The Executable==

Open a DOS Command Window. If you don't know how to do this, refer to the "Getting the Necessary Tools" section above.

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the `trunk\bin` directory inside the directory into which you checked out the open-fvs files. If you had placed the files into a directory called `MyFvsFiles` you would type the command as shown below.
{{{
cd \MyFvsFiles\trunk\bin
}}}
Once you have navigated to the correct directory you are ready to make an executable. The FVS variant executables are named `FVS__.exe`, where the `__` is the 2-letter abbreviation for the variant (e.g., `ie` for Inland Empire or `ls` for Lake States) optionally followed by the 1-letter abbreviation for an extension (e.g., `x` for the insect and disease extensions, or `c` for the climate extension). To make an executable on a Windows PC type the command `make FVS__.exe` with `__` replaced by the variant and extension designations. For example, to build the Inland Empire variant with the Climate extension you would use the command below.
{{{
make FVSiec.exe
}}}
To build the Lake States variant with none of the optional extensions you would use the command below.
{{{
make FVSls.exe
}}}
The variant executable file is created in the `trunk\bin` directory in which you are currently working.

A sourcelist file needs to exist in the `trunk\bin` directory in order to build the variants in this way. For example, the file `FVSls_sourceList.txt` allows you to use the `make` command to build the variant executable `FVSls.exe`. Look in the `trunk\bin` directory to see which variants are currently available.

To build all of the variants for which a sourcelist file exists just type `make` and do not specify a variant. This could take a long time (up to half an hour or more) to complete.

make
