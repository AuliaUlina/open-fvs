This is a basic list of the frequently asked questions (FAQ) for the open-fvs project. 

= Question 1. How do I checkout out the source code? =

You can obtain the source code anonymously using [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion],

{{{
svn checkout http://open-fvs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ open-fvs
}}}

For more information, see the [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/source/checkout Source] link.

= Question 2. How do I build one of the FVS variants? =

From your current directory, check out the source code (see question 1), then change into the `trunk/bin` directory. Then run the the make command using the variant you want to build. For example, to build the [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/overviews/FVSpn_Overview.pdf Pacific Northwest FVS] variant with the climate extension, 

{{{
cd open-fvs/trunk/bin
make FVSpnc
}}}

If the build worked, you should have a listing in your trunk/bin that contains the binary executable file:

{{{
ls -la FVSpnc
-rwxr-xr-x  1 hamannjd  staff  3879324 Feb 21 09:55 FVSpnc
}}}

= Question 3. The build didn't work. Now what? =

If your build doesn't work, that is to say, you don't get an executable on your machine, please see if there is an existing question and answer on this FAQ can first resolves your issue. Since these are being built with new code, please be patient. If you don't get an executable, please build and redirect the make output to a debugging file:

{{{
make FVS[variant] > FVS[variant]-make-output.txt 2>&1
}}}

and submit the problem as a new [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/issues/entry issue]. 

We will ask that you upload this file and the output from the `uname -a` command: 

{{{
uname -a
}}}

when you submit your issue. 

Once you have your files, submit your [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/issues/entry issue here].

= Question 4. Where do I get production versions of the [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ FVS] simulator variants right now? =

This is the link to [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ FVS]

= Question 5. When are you going to complete the FAQ? =

Are they ever complete?

= Question 6. What happens next? =

We have no idea.

= Question 7. Why can't I get _EXTENSION XYZ_ to build? =

The Answer is â€¦
