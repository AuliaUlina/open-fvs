This is a basic list of the frequently asked questions (FAQ) for the open-fvs project. 

= Question 1. How do I checkout out the source code? =

You can obtain the source code anonymously using [http://subversion.apache.org/ Subversion],

{{{
svn checkout http://open-fvs.googlecode.com/svn open-fvs
}}}

For more information, see the [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/source/checkout Source] link.

= Question 2. How do I build one of the FVS variants? =

Since we currently do not have an automated build process, this will depend on your computer platform (e.g. Intel, AMD, etc.) and operating system (e.g. Win32, Win64, MingW, Cygwin, OSX, FreeBSD, etc.). 

A simple solution is to install [http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ Rtools], which is also used to build R under Windows. It includes all the required tools to build FVS for Windows. If you are building under Windows, make sure you read the [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/wiki/BuildProcess_Rtools page for Rtools builds] too.



If you're using another operating system, you should be able to use standard GNU utilities to make the applications. 

Regardless, once you have your tools installed, you should be able to build your FVS variants.

From your current directory, check out the source code (see question 1), then change into the `trunk/bin` directory. Then run the the make command using the variant you want to build. For example, to build the [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/overviews/FVSpn_Overview.pdf Pacific Northwest FVS] variant with the climate extension, 

{{{
cd open-fvs/trunk/bin
make FVSpnc
}}}

If the build worked, you should have a listing in your trunk/bin that contains the binary executable file:

{{{
ls -la FVSpnc
-rwxr-xr-x  1 hamannjd  staff  3879324 Feb 21 09:55 FVSpnc
}}}

= Question 3. The build didn't work. Now what? =

If your build doesn't work, that is to say, you don't get an executable on your machine, attempt to build again and redirect the make output to a debugging file:

{{{
make FVS[variant] > FVS[variant]-make-output.txt 2>&1
}}}

You will also need to provide the operating system, which can be obtained using the output from the `uname -a` command for non-Windows platforms:

{{{
uname -a
Darwin macbook.local 10.8.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.8.0: Tue Jun  7 16:32:41 PDT 2011; root:xnu-1504.15.3~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
}}}

and the `ver` command if you're using Windows:

{{{
C:\open-fvs\trunk\bin>ver

Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]

C:\open-fvs\trunk\bin>
}}}

Once you have those two outputs, submit your problem as a new [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/issues/entry issue].

= Question 4. I am not sure I can trust your code. Where do I get production release versions of the [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ FVS] simulator variants right now? =

This is the link to [http://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/ FVS]

= Question 5. How do I make a new variant? =

The instructions for creating a new variant, from an existing variant, are found [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/wiki/MakeNewFVSProgram here].
