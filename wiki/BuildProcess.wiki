=Build Process=

This Wiki entry documents the build process that is currently available from the sources in open-fvs.

FVS programs are built in the bin directory. The basic approach is to identify the _variant_ of the program you want and use a `make` command a program based on that that variant. 

Currently supported variants are:

  * ie – the Inland Empire of northern Idaho, eastern Washington, and western Montana
  * ne – the northeast US
  * aca – Acaidain (under development), currently mostly based on ne.

Changes in the `makefile` are required to the build other programs in the FVS system using the code posted in open-fvs.

==Build Tools==

The key tools include make, gfortran, and gcc.

For Windows 32-bit, use the Rtools toolkit available from [http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools]. FVS for Windows 64-bit is not yet supported, but it shouldn't be difficult to achieve. There are some commands in the make file that are available in Rtools but not Windows.

For generic Linux, the common tools are usually available for the OS.

==Build==

These build commands work for both Linux and Windows. 

To build the ie variant with the climate extension as a program:

{{{
make FVSiec
}}}

To build ne or aca use one of the following:

{{{
make FVSne
make FVSaca
}}}

To build shared libraries of these programs, add `as.shared=1` to the make commands. Note that if you build a program on Linux and also wish to build a shared library you must first delete all the object code (there is no reliable `make clean` as yet). 

Lastly, to build a working _Data Base Extension_ on 64-bit systems, some changes are needed in `src/dbs/DBSTYPEDEFS.F77` (see the comments in the code).
