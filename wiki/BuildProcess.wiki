#summary Current build information

=Build Process=

This Wiki entry documents the build process that is currently available from the sources in open-fvs.

FVS programs are built in the bin directory. The basic approach is to identify the _program_ you want and use a `make` command to build it.

FVS programs are a combination of an FVS regional _variant_ and one or more _extensions_. An extension adds functions to the core program.

The currently available programs are:

  * FVSiec – the Inland Empire variant plus the Fire and Fuels Extension (FFE) and the Climate Extension.
  * FVSpnc - The Pacific Northwest variant plus FFE and the Climate Extension. 
  * FVSne – The northeast US variant plus FFE.
  * FVSsn – The southern US variant plus FFE. 

Additional programs will be available as we get to them.

==Build Tools==

The key tools include make, gfortran, and gcc. The open-fvs community includes people who routinely build on Windows-32 (under Windows XP and Win7), generic Linux (x86_64), and MAX OSX (x86_64). To build under Windows, we suggest using the same tools the R community use to build R. These tools are know as the Rtools toolkit and it is available from [http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools]. 

==Build==

To make any of the programs listed above, enter the program name as in this example:

{{{
make FVSiec
}}}

To remove all the programs, object files, and build directories, enter:

{{{
