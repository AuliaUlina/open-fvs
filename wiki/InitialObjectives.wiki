As outlined in the _Project Summary_, the initial goal of this project is to involve additional developers in FVS. To that end, the initial activities will be to: 

  * Document the current build processes so others can get started
  * Build a test suite for each FVS variant
  * Add an R code directory that is used to run FVS as a shared library from R. The structure and content under that directory will follow the R standards for an R package.

The initial activities do not include building distribution packages for the general public. That is currently being done by the Forest Service and provided from their web site. 

Eventually, modifying the source and build structure to be more like (or _just like_) a standard GNU open source project is a project goal. Improvements along those lines are welcome.
