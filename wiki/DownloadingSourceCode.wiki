#summary Using an SVN client to download the FVS source files

=Downloading The Source Files=

The open-fvs files are stored in a Subversion (SVN) repository. You will need SVN client software in order to download the source code. There is a wide variety of SVN client software packages for different operating systems available as free downloads from [http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html]. Two more free packages for Windows are Tortoise ([http://tortoisesvn.net]) and SmartSVN ([http://www.smartsvn.com]). There are others available, and we don't endorse the use of any particular software.

You will use the "checkout" feature of your SVN client software package to download the FVS source files. Refer to the documentation for your particular client software if you need help with this. Select or create an appropriate directory on your hard drive into which the source files will be checked out. For example, you could create a directory on your hard drive called `MyFvsFiles` and checkout the repository into that directory.

==Command-Line SVN Downloads==

If you have a command-line SVN client you can use the "Command-line Access" instructions on the [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/source/checkout Source] page of open-fvs to checkout the source files. In order to do the checkout as described you will need to navigate to the directory into which you want to checkout the repository. A username is NOT required to checkout the source files, so you can use any of the methods described on the Source page, or simply use the command shown below. When typing this command don't forget to include the "s" in "https".

{{{
svn checkout https://open-fvs.googlecode.com/svn/ open-fvs
}}}
 
The last part of this command specifies the directory into which the repository will be checked out.  In this example we called the directory "open-fvs". When the command executes you should get a copy of the entire open-fvs repository in the directory you specified. If you don't specify a directory the repository will be copied into the current working directory specified in the command-line console.

==GUI-Based SVN Downloads==

If you have a GUI-based SVN client you will use the appropriate features to checkout the open-fvs repository into the folder you created for this purpose. Refer to the documentation for your particular client software if you need help with the checkout procedure. 

You should specify the repository URL as shown below. When typing this URL don't forget to include the "s" in "https".

{{{
https://open-fvs.googlecode.com/svn
}}}

==Updating Your Copy of the Source Files==

After the initial checkout of the source code you will use the "update" feature of your SVN client to update your local copy of the repository with any changes that have been committed since your last update.

If using a command-line SVN client you can use the command shown below. It is easiest to navigate to your copy of the main repository directory so you don't have to specify it as part of the command.

{{{
svn update
}}}

If you have not navigated to the appropriate directory you will need to add the path to that directory to the end of the command shown above.

If you are using a GUI-based SVN client you will use the "update" feature, which is usually quite simple to use. Some update features are built into the directory navigation system for the operating system. Refer to the SVN client documentation for more information.

==Committing Updates==

Only those designated as committers will be able to commit code changes. Rules and procedures for commits will be covered by a separate wiki.  However, there is one thing that should be mentioned here. Updates should be committed through the *https* version of the URL.  That is why it was suggested you use that URL when doing the intial checkout.  

When committing updates you will be prompted for your googlecode email ID and googlecode password. This is not your normal password. It is assigned by the googlecode site. To see your password, sign in and use the link provided on the [http://code.google.com/p/open-fvs/source/checkout Source] page to retrieve it.
